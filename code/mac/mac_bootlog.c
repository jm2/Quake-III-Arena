// mac_bootlog.c -- a log that survives a freeze or a hard reset
//
// The crash rings in mac_main.c and common.c reach the disk only at quit, at a
// fatal error or on Cmd-D, so a freeze leaves nothing behind. Writing a normal
// log file does not help: HFS records a file's length in the catalog only
// when the file is closed or its volume flushed, so a file that grew since
// then comes back from a hard reset without the new text.
//
// So this file is given its full length once, at startup, and the volume is
// flushed then. Later writes only replace bytes inside that length, and
// PBFlushFileSync sends each one to the disk, which leaves no catalog change
// to lose. Text is held until a whole line is ready. Each line starts with
// the time in seconds, and "<<< end of log >>>" follows the newest text, so
// the end can be found after a reset and after the log wraps. When full, it
// wraps to BOOTLOG_KEEP, keeping the startup at the top of the file.
//
// The log of the previous launch is kept as q3boot.prev.log, because the first
// thing anyone does after a freeze is restart the game.
//
// Each line costs a disk write, and each goes out as it is finished: the last
// line before a freeze is the one that matters, so none is held back. Startup
// and map loads print a few hundred lines, and a frame normally prints none. A
// warning printed every frame will slow the game, and "+set sys_bootlog 0" is
// the way out of that.
//
// Sys_BootLogWrite is for the main task only: the File Manager calls here are
// synchronous, so they must not run at interrupt time.
