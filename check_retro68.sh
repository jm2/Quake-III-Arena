# Check that the Retro68 toolchain runs on this host (issue #269).
#
#   bash check_retro68.sh [--tools-only] [INSTALL_DIR]
#
# INSTALL_DIR defaults to tools/Retro68-build next to this script. Finding the
# programs is not enough: after a host OS upgrade `powerpc-apple-macos-gcc
# --version` still works while cc1, ar, Rez and MakeImport can no longer load
# their shared libraries (libisl, libfl, Boost), and CMake then reports only
# that the compiler identification is unknown. So this script runs the tools
# the build runs, in a scratch directory under ${TMPDIR:-/var/tmp}:
#   - powerpc-apple-macos-gcc --version, then gcc -c and g++ -c with the
#     CMakeLists.txt compile flags (cc1, cc1plus, as);
#   - powerpc-apple-macos-ar and -ranlib on the object, as CMake archives it;
#   - powerpc-apple-macos-ld --version, and MakePEF, MakeImport and Rez with
#     no input, which only has to get past the host loader;
# and, unless --tools-only is given:
#   - a C file that includes <MacTypes.h> and <math.h> is compiled, archived
#     and linked with --whole-archive, -lm and -lInterfaceLib as CMakeLists.txt
#     links Quake3 (ld, libretrocrt, the import libraries);
#   - MakePEF converts the XCOFF image, which must start with Joy!peff/pwpc;
#   - Rez combines that PEF with a resource into an APPL/IDQ3 MacBinary.
# --tools-only leaves out the steps that need the Toolbox headers and target
# libraries, which a --skip-thirdparty rebuild recreates. setup_retro68.sh
# uses it to decide whether resuming a build is safe.
#
# Exit status:
#   0  the toolchain runs;
#   1  the toolchain is broken: the message names the failed step and quotes
#      the tool's output (a library the loader cannot find is named there, and
#      on hosts with ldd every missing library of the toolchain is listed);
#   2  bad usage;
#   3  the check itself could not run, so nothing is known about the
#      toolchain: the scratch directory could not be created or written (a
#      missing, read-only or full TMPDIR, or one out of inodes), a step failed
#      for lack of space or temporary files, or a signal from outside (the OOM
#      killer, a timeout, Ctrl-C) stopped a step.
# Callers must treat only status 1 as a broken toolchain.
